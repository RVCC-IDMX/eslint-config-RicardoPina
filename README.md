# ESLint: Semicolon

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The semi rule is important because it enforces consistent use of semicolons. Since JavaScript doesn't require semicolons at the end of each statement, semicolons could be interpreted differently, potentially causing errors. ESLint enforces the use of semicolons following a specific set of rules. This helps prevent bugs or errors from the misuse of semicolons.
